# My_PathOfExile_Store
# E-Commerce Store for purchasing items that are in my POE account's in-game public trading stash.

# Summary:
The video game Path of Exile has a very clunky trading system in which you must send a direct message to another player you wish to trade with and barter with them. This is typically done via direct messages that are copied and pasted from the Path of Exile Trade website. This website displays all items for every player with a public trading stash and provides a convoluted sorting system that is difficult to navigate. Additionally, you must interact with random players who may attempt to scam or harass you.

I want players to be able to visit my personal shop, sort through my products by category, see my prices, generate a shopping cart, and contact me directly in game through the website for a more positive customer experience. 

Customers who link their steam account will have added functionality to coordinate via Steam to conduct trades while not in game.
